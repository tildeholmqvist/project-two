# Layout & Design

My layout is simple, clean and easy to navigate through.
For a first time visitor the webpage appears structured, with pleasing colours.

#### Colours

The colorscheme for the site is in the blue spectra, beacuse it's a fitting color for the websites theme and purpose. 
The color blue is both easy for the eye, kind and aesthetically nice.

The questionbox is in black and white to make it easy to read and more accessible for the user. 
The answer is in boxes with the borders of the same blue color as the rest of the site. 

#### Images

The image that is being used on the site is an image depicting a hand-painted picture of the earth. 
It contains the same colors as the websites colourscheme.
