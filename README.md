# Layout & Design

My layout is simple, clean and easy to navigate through.
For a first time visitor the webpage appears structured, with pleasing colours.

#### Colours

The colorscheme for the site is in the blue spectra, beacuse it's a fitting color for the websites theme and purpose. 
Blue color also comes with a calming effect, wich is a good thing when the user is gonna test their knowledge. 

The questionbox is in black and white to make it easy to read and more accessible for the user.
